# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Mark  

I‚Äôm a data scientist interested in AI, signal processing, and real-time data. A lot of my work brings together machine learning, audio, and streaming systems.  

I largely work in Python with my typical tech stack including TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Hugging Face, Numpy, Pandas/Polars/Dask and Scikit-Learn in my projects - among many other tools.  

I care about making models more explainable, more reliable, and useful in real-world settings, and making stuff that's practical and actually used if possible.  

I'm currently diving into LLMs, and diving into classic web development on the side as a bit of a hobby project.

‚¨áÔ∏è Check out some of my projects below, & please feel free to reach out.
